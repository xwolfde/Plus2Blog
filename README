Description:
============

This script reads in the activity stream of a Google+ user and sends it to
a given blog using XML-RPC.


Usage:
======

./plus2blog.pl [--userid=i --apikey=s --xmlrpc=s --blog-user=s --blog-pwd=s --configfile=s --indexfile=s --debug]
	--userid=i:     A google plus userid 
	--apikey=s:     An api-key for this script. Get yourself an api-key at http://developers.google.com/+/api/oauth#apikey 
	--xmlrpc=s:     URL to the XML-RPC API of the blog in which all messages are streamed to.
	--blog-user=s:  Username for the blog
	--blog-pwd=s:   Password for the blog
	--configfile=s: Configuration file for all configuration variables; Overrides all parameters and defaults 
	                Readable tabseparated file
	--indexfile=s:  Index of previous blog entries
	--debug:        Sets debug mode on
	--checkonly:	Do not push new entries to blog, just read the g+ stream

In common use you will call this script using crontab. E.g. with an crontab-entry like this:
   10 8-23 * * * /myhome/plus2blog/plus2blog.pl --configfile=/myhome/plus2blog/myconfig.txt >/dev/null 2>&1

Its also possible to push data from more as one g+ stream to a single blog or 
to push data from one g+ stream to several blogs.
In this case you should use several indexfiles for each stream and blog:
The indexfiles will register each article that was already send to a blog before
and will not send it again. Therfor you will habe to use two or more
indexfiles for each target or source stream.

Example: One g+ userid 12345678 as source for an article stream and two blogs as targets:

  ./plus2blog.pl --userid=12345678 --xmlrpc=blog1.example.org/xmlrpc.php --blog-user=blog1user --blog-pwd=something
  ./plus2blog.pl --userid=12345678 --xmlrpc=blog2.example.org/xmlrpc.php --blog-user=blog2user --blog-pwd=something

if there is a file named plus2blog.txt as a configfile, its variables will be used too.
Parameters about command line will override all paraneters within the script an within configfiles.
